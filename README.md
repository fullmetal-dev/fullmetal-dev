# Hello world ðŸ‘‹! I'm Fullmetal Dev

I'm a passionate fullstack developer, working on real projects to help people.

- I use C# as my main backend language.
- I see programming as a craft where you grow every day.
- I aim to use AI wiselyâ€”only when it adds real value to the development process.
- I'm also documenting my development journey on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@fullmetal_dev) (in spanish).
